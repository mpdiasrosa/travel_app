# Travel App

Hello, everyone!

This project was created during [Next Level Week](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/eventos/nlw) hosted by RocketSeat in 2024. It involves the development of a travel registration and management application, utilizing Python as the programming language, Flask as the web framework, setting up the environment, and following best project practices with Virtualenv, SQL, Pylint, and code versioning using pre-commit. It adheres to coding best practices with entities, services, and repositories, and includes automated testing using Pytest.

**Important to note:** I'm aware that the application has a lot of bugs. It was made just to get started and experiment with Flask; it's not a finished product, just created for fun. ;)

## Running the project

To run the project, open the DBeaver database and execute the following command:

```
$ python run.py
```

## Testing the happy path of the application with Postman and Etheral

The collection and environment that I created to test and interact with the app can be found in the Postman Collection directory.

[Etheral](https://ethereal.email/) is a fake SMTP service that helped to test if the email was being sent.
